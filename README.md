ProtoQueueSim

Description:
This mini-project simulates a packet buffer using a circular queue in C. It mimics basic network buffer behavior in embedded systems, where packets are enqueued and dequeued manually using array-based data structure.

Features:
- Packet with ID, Source, Destination, Size
- Circular queue logic
- Queue full & empty handling
- Manual display of packet queue

Tech Used:
- Language: Embedded-style C
- Concepts: Data Structures (Circular Queue), Computer Networks (Packet Buffering)
